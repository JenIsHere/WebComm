	<p class = homeSubHead> Ideal </p>
	<p class="generalText"> Visualize the contested areas of the Whitebelt/Greenbelt in the form of an interactive web map for public awareness. </p>
	<p class = homeSubHead> Reality </p>
	<p class="generalText"> Municipalities are expected to make an informed decision this year which will impact the white belt  and surrounding areas for the next 30 years. It is important to display which areas have already been contested on both sides. </p>
	<p class = homeSubHead> Consequences </p>
	<p class="generalText"> Unplanned construction in the Whitebelt can lead to the loss of agricultural land as well as depreciation of natural heritage which is in close proximity to the greenbelt. It also increases the risk of flooding downstream if it disrupts the existing watershed.  </p>
	<p class = homeSubHead> Proposal </p>
	<p class="generalText"> Implement an interactive web map showing the existing greenbelt and white belt boundaries, with geographical physical features. Contested areas will be displayed as points with popup information about each area respectfully. Information will include if that area has been recently added to the greenbelt or if it has been pinned for future urban development. </p>
