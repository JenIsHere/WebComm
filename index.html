    <h2 class = "title4"> Problem Statement</h1>
	<p class = homeSubHead> Ideal </p>
	<p class="generalText"> Visualize the contested areas of the Whitebelt/Greenbelt in the form of an interactive web map for public awareness. </p>
	<p class = homeSubHead> Reality </p>
	<p class="generalText"> Municipalities are expected to make an informed decision this year which will impact the white belt  and surrounding areas for the next 30 years. It is important to display which areas have already been contested on both sides. </p>
	<p class = homeSubHead> Consequences </p>
	<p class="generalText"> Unplanned construction in the Whitebelt can lead to the loss of agricultural land as well as depreciation of natural heritage which is in close proximity to the greenbelt. It also increases the risk of flooding downstream if it disrupts the existing watershed.  </p>
	<p class = homeSubHead> Proposal </p>
	<p class="generalText"> Implement an interactive web map showing the existing greenbelt and white belt boundaries, with geographical physical features. Contested areas will be displayed as points with popup information about each area respectfully. Information will include if that area has been recently added to the greenbelt or if it has been pinned for future urban development. </p>

    <p class="homeSubHead"> About This Project</p>
    <p class="generalText">This project is created in order to develop the necessary skillsets in Web GIS Development as well as creating an appealing webpage and will be submitted at the end of Winter 2022 term. Team JPC will implement the acquired knowledge of open-source software such as Leaflet and Mapbox to create a solution. This knowledge will be put to further use for Collaborative Project during the Spring 2022 term.</p>

    <p class="generalText"> The Ontario Headwaters Institute works to protect Ontario’s watersheds, their natural heritage, and receiving waters such as the Great Lakes. Under Place to Grow:Growth Plan, municipalities of the Greater Golden Horseshoe area required to update their development and landuse plans to predict the growth through 2051. The current situation suggests that the municipalities could opt to expand their urban boundaries at the expense of agricultural lands of the Whitebelt. For this project, the OHI would like the JPC team to create a tool to raise public awareness regarding the imminent loss of natural heritage. </p>
